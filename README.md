# Horiseon - Branding Agency Website

## Description

I was approached by a marketing agency to update their website's codebase. Their goal was to meet accessibility standards and optimize the site for search engines.

I took this project to help businesses do better in the digital world.

Horiseon, as a marketing company, didn't have the online presence they always wished for. This project brings together all their marketing efforts, making SEO, online reputation, and social media marketing more organized

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into web accessibility, emphasizing the importance of creating user-friendly and inclusive websites.
